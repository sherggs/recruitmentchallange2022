I started by making a use state hook with the name newsData 
I loaded the data.json on node with nodemon to host it on http://localhost:3002/
then const LoadData with an asynchronous function to get the json file 
I implemented useEffect 
I then mapped the entire data needed into the newsCard

Thank you for the amazing challenge.
